                        <p><strong>Industry.</strong> Affiliate Marketing, Student Discounts</p>
                        <p><strong>Problem.</strong> The homepage was under-performing. Users primarily relied on keyword search to find specific brands, resulting in low engagement and infrequent returns. The goal was to redesign the homepage to encourage users to explore more content and return to the app regularly.</p>
                        <p><strong>Platform.</strong> Android, iOS</p>
                        <p><strong>Role & Responsibilities.</strong> UX/UI Design, Research – Led end-to-end design process, conducting both qualitative and quantitative user research.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact.</strong> Delivered a statistically significant uplift in key business metrics, including Week 1 return rate and engagement rate.</p>

                        <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
                        <p>I analysed existing data and conducted quantitative (survey) and qualitative (moderated user testing) research to understand how users engage with the homepage as a starting point for key journeys.</p>
                        <p>Users faced several discovery challenges:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong> Confusing information architecture.</strong> Many questioned, "Where is the homepage?"</li>
                            <li><strong>Lack of brand visibility.</strong> Users struggled to see how many and which brands offered discounts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cluttered experience.</strong> Non-essential content—polls, videos, large images, and detailed descriptions—distracted from core actions.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Formalized</strong> Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) and core journeys to guide the design process.</p>

                        <p><strong>Developed</strong> actionable design requirements focused on navigation to four key destination types, aligning with business objectives.</p>
                        <p><strong>Collaborated</strong> with stakeholders to establish success metrics, ensuring the solution's impact could be effectively evaluated.</p>
                        <p><strong>Facilitated</strong> a prioritization workshop using an Impact-Effort Matrix with engineers to confirm feasibility and focus on high-value areas.</p>

                        <h2>Exploring & Prototyping Solutions</h2>
                        <p><strong>Business needs.</strong> Replaced the single feed with themed sections, creating a more flexible and scalable framework. This allowed for future experimentation with reordering and new sections to test what resonates most with users.</p>
                        <p><strong>User needs.</strong> Prioritised relevant content, removing elements with little impact on discoverability (e.g., polls, videos). Designed smaller, cleaner tiles aligned with user expectations. Introduced multiple new components to reduce repetition and enhance engagement.</p>
                        <p><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP).</strong> Collaborated with developers to deliver a fast, high-impact homepage update, ensuring value for users while accelerating time to market.</p>

                        <p><strong>Usability Testing & Feedback.</strong> Qualitative research confirmed the new design improved user experience. Users appreciated the clear sections and smaller tiles, which made finding relevant content easier. The flexible, scalable structure also created new business opportunities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Implementation & Impact.</strong> Redesigning the entire homepage complicated A/B testing. The initial test introduced too many changes, obscuring results and causing unexpected metric declines. This led to discussions with stakeholders to define key growth-driving metrics versus low-risk ones. A refined A/B test with clearer focus delivered significant results, leading to a full rollout.</p>
